# Reduced-Khovanov-Homology
This includes a set of programs which compute the categorification of the reduced n-coloured Jones polynomial. To run the program, download the folder and in Matlab run the command ncablecube(n,m,v) where n is the number of colours, m is the number of strands in the braid representation of the knot, and v is the vector representing this braid, where each component of v is an integer from 1 to m-1 with a positive sign for a positive crossing and negative sign for a negative crossing, and |v(i)|=j means the ith elementary braid in the braid representing the knot crosses the jth and (j+1)st strands.

All of this code is original except the refmod program for calculating reduced echelon form modulo an integer, which is found at https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23266-refmod
